Certainly! Here are five exercises to practice file handling in C programming:

### Exercise 1: Basic File Reading and Output

Write a program that reads content from a text file (`input.txt`) and outputs it to the console.

### Exercise 2: File Copy

Write a program that copies the contents of one file (`source.txt`) to another file (`destination.txt`). 
Make sure to handle errors if the source file does not exist or if there are issues with opening or writing to the destination file.

### Exercise 3: File Word Count

Write a program that reads a text file (`textfile.txt`) and counts the number of words in it.
 Words are separated by spaces, tabs, or newline characters.

### Exercise 4: File Line Count

Write a program that reads a text file (`data.txt`) and counts the number of lines in it.
 Each line ends with a newline character (`'\n'`).

### Exercise 5: File Append

Write a program that prompts the user to enter a line of text and appends this line to a file (`log.txt`).
 If the file doesnâ€™t exist, it should be created. Ensure proper error handling for file opening and writing operations.

### Exercise 6: File Random Access

Write a program that demonstrates random access to a binary file (`data.bin`).
 Implement functions to read and write records at specific positions in the file.
 Records can be a struct with fields like ID, name, age, etc.

These exercises cover a range of file handling operations in C and will help you become 
familiar with manipulating files, handling errors, and working with both text and binary files.
